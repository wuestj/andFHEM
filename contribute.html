  <h2>Feature Requests & Ideas</h2>
  
  <p>Feel free to open an issue within the issue tracker or send me an <a href="mailto:andfhem@klass.li">email</a>. However, do not expect the new features to be implemented immediately. My time horizon is also very limited.</p>
  
  <h2>Can I support you?</h2>
  
  <p>App development is very time intensive. I am happy if you think the app is great and want to support the future development. There's a premium version available, which currently only removes some few advertisements within the app. It does not have any more features, as I do not want to force anyone to buy the version. However, feel free to do so!</p>
  
  <p>If you think this symbolical amount of money for the premium version is too less and want to donate some more money, feel free to use Paypal.</p>
